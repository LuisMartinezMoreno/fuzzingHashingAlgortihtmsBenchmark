# Fuzzy hashing algorithm benchmark

## Description
This paper explores the implementation and application of fuzzy hashing algorithms to detect alterations in provided data, email content was used as an example of identifying malicious URLs and addresses. The study focuses on comparing authentic emails with those manipulated to include potentially harmful links or content.

The implemented fuzzy hashing algorithms provide a means to calculate robust hashes that exhibit similarity in the presence of slight modifications. Ssdeep excels in identifying similarities in text-based content, TLSH offers a hash function designed for variable-length inputs, and Nilsimsa provides context-aware hashing. These algorithms collectively enhance the capability to discern subtle changes in emails, making them valuable tools for cybersecurity applications.
